I am a PhD student at CentraleSupelec since October 2015. I am interested by reconfigurable 
computing (e.g. FPGA, SoC) and secure embedded systems. The subject of my thesis is to design a 
secure system using Zynq SoC. 
Besides my work, I am interested by teaching and I had done a few videos on youtube which you 
can find on my youtube channel. 
You can have a look at my publications here and if you want to contact me, you can find more 
information here.
